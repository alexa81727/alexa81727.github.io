    <p>What better subject to create a website around than myself! My name is Alexa Lee and I was born in Sacramento, California and moved to Georgia when I was 10 years old.
	I am currently a Junior at the University of Georgia majoring in Sport Management and Entertainment and Media Studies. A typical day in my life looks like:
	<table STYLE="background-color: #FF6666" border=5 width="50%" Cellpadding="4" Cellspacing="3"> 
		<tr>
			<th>Class</th><th>Monday</th><th>Tuesday</th><th>Wednesday</th><th>Thursday</th><th>Friday</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>1st</td><td>CSCI 1100 Lab</td><td>Business Stat</td><td>CSCI 1100 Lab</td><td>Business Stat</td><td rowspan=3>Work</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>2nd</td><td>CSCI 1100</td><td>Marketing</td><td>CSCI 1100</td><td>Marketing</td>

	<p> When I'm not busy working as a Desk Attendant in Reed Hall, I love to watch sporting events. My favorite sport is baseball but football has slowly grown on me during my time here at UGA. I've always had a passion for baseball and I think it stems from my time playing softball as a child. My favorite sports teams include: 
		<object> <ul>
		<li> <A href = "http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=nyy"> New York Yankees</A></li>
		<li> <A href = "http://www.georgiadogs.com"> Georgia Bulldogs</A></li>
		</ul> </object>
	</p>

	<p> Here at UGA, I try to stay as active as I can. I am currently in the Delta Phi Epsilon sorority and intern at Seacrest Studios at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. As an intern, I get to create my own radio show for kids along with four other college interns. After I graduate from UGA, I hope to pursue a career either working on television shows in Los Angeles or traveling around the country with different baseball teams to produce live broadcasts. I have been through many challenges over the last few years and therefore, I try to live by the mantra <q>Never Give Up!</q> Thanks for visiting my web page and I hope you enjoyed getting to know a little more about me!
